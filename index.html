                    mobility, manage pain, and enhance their overall well-being. With experience at A Plus Hospital and
                    Avcılar Private Hospital, I have worked in diverse healthcare settings, applying advanced
                    therapeutic techniques to support effective recovery.

                    My approach focuses on personalized care, ensuring that each patient receives a treatment plan
                    tailored to their unique needs. I have also pursued specialized training in Cupping Therapy and
                    Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) to provide the best possible care.

                    Whether you’re recovering from an injury or looking to improve your movement, I’m here to support
                    you on your journey to better health. Let’s work together to achieve your goals!</p>

                <p class="review">“I was a little nervous about choosing a physical therapist because I had never done
                    physical therapy before. When I started with Chrissy, my left hip ached every day and I couldn’t run
                    or sometimes even walk without pain. Chrissy put together a plan for me to gradually build up
                    strength while treating the pain and addressing the underlying issues. Within 3 months, I was back
                    to running with almost zero pain. Chrissy was super kind, knowledgeable, and professional throughout
                    the entire process. She truly cared about how I was doing on a daily and weekly basis. I can't
                    recommend her highly enough!”</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p class="review">“Christine Miller is an exceptionally knowledgable, caring, and dedicated
                    professional. She possesses an in-depth understanding of body mechanics, which enables her to
                    identify the root cause of an underlying issue leading to the injury. In my case, while I did not
                    have any hopes to get back to my strenuous sport activities, she treated my back injury and now I
                    can do even better than before. A remarkable characteristics of hers is that she educates the
                    patient which makes the treatment much more effective. I highly recommend her.” </p>

                    muscle spasms and could barley lift my arm up. She helped massage out the knots, stretch and also
                    gave me exercises to keep me on the right track that I can continue to do regularly. Christine also
                    is quick to help answer my questions even if I can’t come into the office because of my busy work
                    schedule. I highly recommend her services. She really cares about her patients and their best
                    interests.” ”</p>

                    It had been bothering me for months, and I couldn't get any relief. She quickly identified that it
                    was actually a pinched nerve in my neck, and began treating me for that. She set me up with a
                    program of exercises to do at home, which has been so helpful since the outbreak of Covid-19. She
                    has consistently followed up with me since I've been staying home, checking in on my progress and
                    offering new exercises to help. I'm finally feeling relief after months of discomfort. I highly
                    recommend her services! She truly cares for and listens to her patients.”</p>
